## Overview

This project implements an **adaptive speed controller system**, designed for embedded applications. It interfaces with various hardware components such as **Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs)**, a **GPS module**, **radio communication modules** (transmitters/receivers), and displays data on an **SSD1306 display**. The controller adapts its speed based on incoming sensor data and other factors.

Target Platform: **ESP8266 (NodeMCU)**

## Features

- Adaptive speed control based on GPS and sensor data
- Interfacing with Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs)
- GPS data processing for position and movement tracking
- Radio communication for remote control
- Integration with **NodeMCU ESP8266** microcontroller
- Display information on **SSD1306 OLED display** (optional)

## Technologies Used

- **C++** for embedded development
- **NodeMCU ESP8266** as the microcontroller platform
- Libraries for GPS, ESC, radio communication, and SSD1306 display

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and flash the firmware to your NodeMCU ESP8266.

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/adaptive-speed-controller.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd adaptive-speed-controller
    ```
3. **Prerequisites:**
   - Install the necessary development tools (e.g., Arduino IDE, PlatformIO).
   - Ensure you have the ESP8266 toolchain and libraries installed (e.g., GPS, SSD1306, ESC libraries).

4. **Build the project:**
   - Open the project in your preferred IDE (Arduino IDE or PlatformIO).
   - Select the ESP8266 board (NodeMCU) as the target.
   - Compile the code using your IDEâ€™s build system.

5. **Flash the firmware:**
    - Connect your NodeMCU to your computer via USB.
    - Upload the compiled firmware to the ESP8266 using your IDE's upload function.

> **Note:** Specific build commands may vary depending on your development environment (e.g., PlatformIO, Arduino IDE).

## Usage

Once the firmware is uploaded to your NodeMCU, follow these steps to use the adaptive speed controller:

1. **Connect hardware:**
   - Wire up the ESCs, GPS module, radio communication modules (if applicable), and the SSD1306 display (optional).
   
2. **Power the system:**
   - Once powered on, the controller will start processing the GPS data, radio inputs, and other sensor data.

3. **Operation:**
   - The system will adjust the ESCs based on the adaptive speed control algorithm.
   - Data (e.g., speed, position) will be displayed on the SSD1306 OLED display, if configured.

> **Note:** Calibration and specific configuration might be required based on your hardware setup.
